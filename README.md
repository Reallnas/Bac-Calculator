# 💯 Baccalaureate calculator 💯

## Presentation

Small Baccalaureate calculator, made to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It's really simple and has lots of errors but it did the job.

You can enter your grades and your options. 
Then by clicking on `Calculer`, the page will tell you if you have the baccalaureate and what honors you got.
If you managed to get the bac (congratulations 👏 !), you can visualize a mock-up of it by clicking on `Pré-visualiser votre diplôme`.

## Language

As it was done for a french Highschool project, the calculator UI is entirely in French <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Flag_of_France.svg/langfr-225px-Flag_of_France.svg.png" width="40" height="25" />.
